# How to Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It comes with npm (Node Package Manager) to manage packages and dependencies. Follow these steps to install Node.js on your system.

# Installing Node.js on Windows

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Download the Windows Installer (.msi) for the LTS (Long Term Support) version or the Current version, depending on your requirements. It's recommended to choose the LTS version for most use cases.

3. Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded .msi file.

4. Follow the installation wizard's instructions. You can accept the default settings for most options.

5. Once the installation is complete, open your Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:

   ```sh
   node -v
   npm -v
You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal.

#Installing Node.js on macOS
Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Download the macOS Installer (.pkg) for the LTS (Long Term Support) version or the Current version, depending on your requirements. It's recommended to choose the LTS version for most use cases.

Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded .pkg file.

Follow the installation wizard's instructions. You can accept the default settings for most options.

Once the installation is complete, open your Terminal and run the following command to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal.

# Installing Node.js on Linux (Using NodeSource)
Open your terminal.

First, you need to install curl if you don't have it already. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl
```
For other Linux distributions, use the respective package manager to install curl.

Install Node.js using NodeSource by running the following commands (replace 14.x with the desired LTS version, e.g., 16.x):

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Once the installation is complete, verify that Node.js and npm are installed by running:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Node.js and npm on your system. You can now start building and running JavaScript applications on your machine.
